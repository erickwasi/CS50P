# Medical Database Using Python and CSV

## Libraries Used
from tabulate import tabulate  ## displays database
from datetime import date  ## calculates age
from sys import exit  ## exits 
import csv  ## exports database into csv file

print("", end = "\n") ## prints an extra line for aesthetic purposes

## ensures that database doesn't return to default settings when programme is rerun
